# pomodoro
This is a simple pomodoro app that I've made using pictures from my trip to New Zealand. I've always been a fan of pomodoro timer and figured why not build one myself from scratch. 
I am planning to add more features in the future, e.g. Having a pomodoro session with friends or having your focus/break time saved.
